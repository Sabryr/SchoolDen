  <h2>Business case</h2>
  <p>
	John and Anne are moving to Toronto. John works mainly from home and traveling to the office only one day per week.
	Anne has not found a job yet and she is a trained teacher. After moving to Toronto she would start looking for work.
	They are also planing to have children. Therefore, they decided to purchase a house in a neighborhood where there is a high density of schools.
	This would increase the chance that Anne would find a job near the house so she can minimize traveling. Then when they have children
	there is a high probability that they can find a school near the house.
